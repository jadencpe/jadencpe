- 👋 Hi, I’m Jaden, and I am a firm believer in the resurrection of Pierce The Veil, and its impending rise back into fame.
- 👀 I’m interested in Vic Fuentes, I am a Vic Supremacist, I believe in Fuentes Supremacy.
- In the name of the father vic, the son, gerard, and the holy spirit, jonathan davis... amen.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning every pierce the veil song known to man (the acoustic version) on the guitar.
- 💞️ Pfft, love? Romance? It's a sham anyway, do I look like I have the time for that non-sense? *cough cough* **kilala niyo kung sino kayo**.
- Just focus on studying, yk? I'm kidding, I am absolutely, mind-numbingly desperate, a hopeless romantic.
- 📫 How to reach me ... to reach me is very easy, all you have to do is bend down a little.
